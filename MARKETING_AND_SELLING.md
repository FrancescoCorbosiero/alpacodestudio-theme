   - 5-day email course
   - How to migrate from Tailwind to CSS4
   - Code examples & best practices
   - CTA: "Use our theme as your foundation"

### 6.3 Sales Objection Handling

**Objection:** "Why not just use Tailwind? Everyone else does."

**Response:**
- "Tailwind is great for rapid prototyping, but it creates 500KB+ CSS bundles that hurt your client's SEO and conversions. Our CSS4 approach gives you the same developer experience with 10x smaller bundles. Would you like to see a side-by-side Lighthouse comparison?"

**Objection:** "I can build this myself with Sage starter."

**Response:**
- "Absolutely, you could. But how many hours would it take to build the component library, service layer, accessibility testing, performance optimization, and documentation? Our customers report saving 40-60 hours of development per project. At your hourly rate, we pay for ourselves in the first project."

**Objection:** "Too expensive compared to ThemeForest themes."

**Response:**
- "Fair concern. ThemeForest themes are $49, we're $149-$1,499. Here's the difference: those themes have 50+ plugins, 5MB bundles, terrible accessibility, and zero support. You'll spend 20+ hours cleaning up the code. Our theme is production-ready, supported, and saves you weeks of work. Which is actually more expensive?"

**Objection:** "What if CSS4 features aren't supported in older browsers?"

**Response:**
- "Great question. We use progressive enhancement and PostCSS fallbacks. The theme works perfectly in IE11 (basic styling) and progressively enhances in modern browsers. 95%+ of users get the full experience, while older browsers get a perfectly functional site. We also provide a browser support matrix in our docs."

**Objection:** "My clients won't see the difference."

**Response:**
- "They won't see the code, but they'll absolutely notice their site loading 2-3x faster, ranking higher in Google (thanks to Core Web Vitals), and converting better (100ms faster = 1% revenue increase). Plus, you'll have an easier time explaining why your sites are faster and more accessible than competitors. Want to see a client testimonial about this?"

**Objection:** "I need more components than what's included."

**Response:**
- "We hear you. That's why we have Component Expansion Packs ($49-$99 each) for advanced needs like tables, charts, and e-commerce. The base theme includes 6 essential components that cover 80% of use cases. But if you're building complex applications, the expansion packs give you exactly what you need without bloat. Which components are you most interested in?"

## Conclusion

This premium CSS4-first Sage theme enters the market at a unique inflection point:

1. **Performance is now a ranking factor** (Core Web Vitals)
2. **Accessibility is becoming legally required** (WCAG compliance)
3. **CSS4 has reached critical mass** (95%+ browser support)
4. **Framework fatigue is setting in** (developers want simpler solutions)

Our positioning as a "framework-free, performance-first, accessibility-native" theme addresses all of these trends simultaneously. By focusing on the professional WordPress developer market (agencies and enterprises), we can command premium pricing while delivering measurable ROI.

The key to success is **education-based marketing**: teaching developers why CSS4 is the future, showing them the performance benefits, and making it easy to try and adopt. Our comprehensive documentation, component library, and service architecture reduce the perceived risk of switching from familiar frameworks.

With a solid launch strategy, aggressive but realistic growth targets, and a focus on customer success, this theme can become the de facto standard for performance-conscious WordPress development.

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute pre-launch plan (weeks 1-4)
2. Nail the launch (week 5-6)
3. Scale what works (weeks 7-12)
4. Build for the long term (years 1-3)

Let's build the future of WordPress themes.
